# Changes coming in 2.0

- Button is no longer disable-able.  See recommendation on `Element.Input`.
- `Font.external` has been removed.  Fonts need to be included in the `<head>` of the html document in order to avoid the render flashing.  Remember to set `font-display: swap`!
- `scrollbars`, `scrollbarX`, and `scrollbarY` have been removed in favor of `viewport`.
- `modular` has been removed.  More recently I've had a preference for simpler scales with explicit values instead of being generated via function.  Though feel free to copy-paste that function into your project if you like it!
- `clipX`, `clipY` have been moved in favor of `clipped`.
